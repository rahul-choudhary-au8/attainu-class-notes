## Navbar

- navigation bars are used for easy access to separate page sections
- they make moving around a web page easy and user friendly for the end user
- nav bar has stuff like:
  - page sections - /about, /contact, /careers, etc
  - a logo

### Navbar tips

- more than 5 common options are discouraged to use in design
- if lot's of options one can hide them into drop down menu or something
- as a rule of thumb limit font size to 16px in nav bar
- for colors, flip/oppose them that is, use contrasting colors for better readability and visual appeal

## Forms

### Why

- newsletters (service)
- advertisements (offers)
- data analytics
- login
  - to know who is end user
  - adding a level of security to avoid scammy end users
  - authentication
  - "remember me?" option for easier access later
  - some examples from dribble.com

### Making logical decisions

- bounce rate - end user who visited web app without viewing content
- making forms more intuitive with real time validation
- using buttons according to usage scenarios or context
  - like create ac button is highlighted/attractive whereas cancel button is boring/neutral

## Empty state of a web application

- stuff that is shown to end user as soon as he visits a web app for the first time
- 2 checks:
  - you as a developer has role to provide end user resources from server
    - status of website
    - loading screen or an intuitive prompt of what is going on
    - something to ensure the end user is kept engaged
  - end user part like if she/he doesn't have internet connection
    - prompt user with friendly "error message" prompt

## Dashboard views

- it depends on website we're working on
- dashboard is admin panel which is hidden from "non-registered" user
- building dashboards is good for flexing your development skills
- rave about how great is razorpay.com üòÖ

## Buttons and actions

- actions vs buttons:
  - button make sure something interactive happens when one clicks on them, some state getting changed
  - action do something, like re-direction

## Colors

- very broad topic
- it's foolish to take color scheme of a website lightly, they matter, a lot
- goal is to use colors that invoke appropriate feels
  - like for calming effect use green/blue
- like youtube, coke, netflix uses red since it has most wavelength -- these brands wants to pop out

### Rule of thumbüëç

- think a lot before slapping a color pallete into your website

## Typography

- attention is an asset from end user, you need to use fonts such that attention is grabbed in a profitable manner
- bold fonts catches eyes more easily
- be consciously aware about font-sizes you choose

### Tips for good typography

1. understand font families
1. use few fonts
1. respect font integrity - do NOT distort font's shape or size beyond logic
1. use hierarchical (arrange fonts in an ordered way) font structure

## Modals

- **dialogs** provide yes/no or two generic options, one changes stuff and one returns/stay in same area
- **pop overs** are for informative in nature, like alert saying "access denied"
- **tabs** are linking together seperate web pages based on their context
- **tool tips** provides additional information about some page element when you hover over it
- **pagination** limit amount of results at time to avoid server overload, like in amazon.in when one search mobile, out of 10,000 results just 10 or so are shown

## Testing your design

- 5 second test
- first click test

## Spacing and layout

- important to make use of space to organize content such that it is visually pleasing
- elements/page content must look easily differntiable so that end user doesn't get confused

## Using charts and graphs

- to add visual element and represent data in attractive manner since textual data is inherently boring

## Using icons

- icons enchance site interactivity, triggers user sense of familiarity, so that
